# Hangman Game

An interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) Hangman game built with Node.js. Players guess letters to complete a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts.

## Features

- üéÆ Interactive CLI gameplay
- üéØ Random word selection from a predefined list
- ‚úÖ Real-time feedback on correct/incorrect guesses
- üìù Track of guessed letters and remaining attempts
- üîÑ Option to play multiple games
- üõ°Ô∏è Input validation and error handling

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- No additional dependencies required (uses built-in `readline` module)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project1
   ```

2. The game is ready to run! No installation required.

## How to Run

### Method 1: Direct Execution
```bash
node hangman.js
```

### Method 2: Using the Hangman Class in Your Code
```javascript
const Hangman = require('./hangman.js');

// Create a new game with default settings
const game = new Hangman();
game.play();

// Or create a game with custom word list and attempts
const customWords = ['python', 'javascript', 'react', 'nodejs'];
const game2 = new Hangman(customWords, 8); // 8 attempts instead of 6
game2.play();
```

## Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Guess the hidden word by suggesting letters
2. **Attempts**: You have 6 attempts by default (configurable)
3. **Gameplay**: 
   - Enter one letter at a time
   - Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word
   - Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining attempts
   - Win by guessing the complete word before running out of attempts

## Class Methods

### Constructor
```javascript
new Hangman(wordList, maxAttempts)
```
- `wordList` (optional): Array of words to choose from
- `maxAttempts` (optional): Maximum number of attempts (default: 6)

### Core Methods

#### `selectRandomWord()`
Selects a random word from the wordList and sets the word property.

#### `initializeGame()`
Initializes the game state by resetting attempts, guesses, and currentState.

#### `makeGuess(letter)`
Takes a letter from the player, adds it to the guesses array, updates the currentState, and returns feedback.
- Returns: `'correct'`, `'incorrect'`, or `'already guessed'`

#### `isGameOver()`
Returns true if the player has used all attempts or guessed the word correctly.

#### `getCurrentState()`
Returns the current state of the word with guessed letters and underscores for unguessed letters.

#### `play()`
Runs the interactive game loop using console inputs and outputs.

## Customization Examples

### Custom Word List
```javascript
const Hangman = require('./hangman.js');

const myWords = ['javascript', 'python', 'react', 'nodejs', 'mongodb'];
const game = new Hangman(myWords);
game.play();
```

### Custom Attempts
```javascript
const Hangman = require('./hangman.js');

// Easy mode with 10 attempts
const easyGame = new Hangman([], 10);
easyGame.play();

// Hard mode with 4 attempts
const hardGame = new Hangman([], 4);
hardGame.play();
```

### Programmatic Usage
```javascript
const Hangman = require('./hangman.js');

const game = new Hangman(['test', 'example']);

// Initialize the game
game.initializeGame();
console.log('Word:', game.word); // 'test' or 'example'

// Make a guess
const result = game.makeGuess('t');
console.log('Result:', result); // 'correct'

// Check game state
console.log('Current state:', game.getCurrentState()); // 't__t'
console.log('Is game over:', game.isGameOver()); // false
```

## Error Handling

The game includes comprehensive input validation:
- Ensures only single letters are entered
- Validates that input is alphabetic
- Prevents duplicate guesses
- Handles invalid input gracefully

## Technical Details

- **Encapsulation**: All game state is properly encapsulated within the class
- **Modularity**: The class can be easily imported and used in other projects
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features like different difficulty levels or word categories
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all methods
